        "The OTP Verification System is a Python-based project designed to enhance security by providing a robust mechanism for verifying user identity through One-Time Passwords (OTPs). The system generates a unique 6-digit OTP, which is sent to the user's email address. The user then enters this OTP into the system for validation. Successful validation grants access, while failure to match the OTP denies access. This project emphasizes secure, reliable, and user-friendly verification processes, ensuring the integrity of user authentication."

The system aims to provide an additional layer of security for user verification through email-based OTP delivery and validation."
